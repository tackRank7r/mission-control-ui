## Ops Review
- **Calls:** 3 outbound, 2 answered, 1 voicemail.
- **Incidents:** Launch screen regression closed.
- **Reminders:** Configure OTP email for SideKick360 scheduling flow.

## Decisions
1. Adopt OpenAI TTS fallback so hotline calls keep working when ElevenLabs is down.
2. Persist conversation snippets to the new second brain so context is searchable.

## Next Up
- Wire SendGrid summary template.
- Prototype Next.js interface (this project!).
