# Mission
- Build an autonomous ops layer that keeps Bill's world in order 24/7.
- Every tool must either unlock time, reduce stress, or surface better decisions.

# Current Pillars
1. **Signal Triage** – summarize + route all inbound messages twice per day.
2. **Ops Rhythm** – heartbeat reminders, service checks, and call summaries.
3. **Mission Graph** – a unified view of docs, notes, tasks, and memories.

# Non-Negotiables
- Keep workflows codename-free unless explicitly requested.
- Any automation touching finances needs dual confirmation.
- Document every outage + fix within 15 minutes.

# Opportunities
- Expose cron + heartbeat states inside the UI.
- Surface "decisions made" as a first-class view so we can revisit context fast.

# Cadence & Memory Rules (2026-02-15 refresh)
- Mission Control status updates every 30 minutes between 09:00–17:00 CST. If the primary agent is busy, immediately delegate the check-in to the least busy sub-agent so the window never slips.
- Keep memory capture simple but relentless: log the day’s events in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, move standing rules into `LONG_TERM_MEMORY.md`, and keep heartbeat reminders for cadence-critical habits (30-min updates, Mission Control sync, sub-agent summaries).
- Mission Control branding is canonical; scrub “Second Brain” references from the UI and docs going forward.
- Never re-enable the "100% memory saving / 24h compaction" experiment; it caused more harm than help.
