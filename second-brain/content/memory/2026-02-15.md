## Memory Workflow Reset
- Re-read Feb 14–15 chat log and pulled instructions back into workspace after the reset.
- Daily memory logging is now mandatory again: capture every mission decision + blockers here so we can skim once per session instead of rereading whole transcripts.
- `LONG_TERM_MEMORY.md` now mirrors the standing rules (30-min cadence, Mission Control principles, heartbeat reminders).
- Snapshot of the memory folder lives at `~/Desktop/MissionControlMemoryBackup/` plus a direct copy of `Memory.md` on the Desktop so we can recover quickly after future wipes.

## Status Cadence + Delegation
- Bill reiterated: deliver Mission Control status summaries every 30 minutes between 09:00–17:00 CST. No skips.
- If the primary agent can’t hit a window, it must delegate the check-in to the least-busy sub-agent automatically.
- Heartbeat reminders should include “confirm 30-min updates, sync Mission Control, summarize sub-agent status” so cadence stays top-of-mind.

## Mission Control Workstreams (Feb 14 snapshot)
1. **Hotline** – Backend flow built but Twilio isn’t wired or live-tested. Next step: run a real call via the Runbook and log the result.
2. **Mission Control UI** – Panels + Agents view exist but still use mock data. Needs live API wiring plus branding swap from “Second Brain” to “Mission Control” with the new Current Context panel.
3. **OTP Deployment** – Spec exists, but OTP endpoints, DB fields, and SendGrid hooks aren’t implemented. Deployment blocked until those land.
4. **Buttons Not Responding** – UI refactor changed the loader signature and buttons short-circuit. Need to rewire click handlers so Sync + Ping Hotline hit the API again.
5. **Voice Controls** – Hotline-only flow being wired under the 30-min reporting cadence; next update due every half-hour until done.
6. **Hosted OTP Agent** – Relaunched with tighter brief to finish the hosted release (OTP login, Vercel env, smoke tests). Must report on progress every 30 minutes like the other agents.

## Other Notes
- Mission Control now has new Agents tab (reading from `content/agents.json`) and a Current Context card that should always reflect sync health, active tasks, and hotline status once the data source is live.
- User asked for a 5-day Canada hiking trip plan (pending once core ops are stable).
- Never re-enable the “100% memory saving with 24h compaction” experiment; it was too aggressive.
