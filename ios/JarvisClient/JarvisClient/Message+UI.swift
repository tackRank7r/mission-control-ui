// File: ios/JarvisClient/JarvisClient/Message+UI.swift
// Action: REPLACE entire file
// Purpose: Deprecated shim – currently no extra UI helpers needed.

import Foundation

/// This file is intentionally minimal.
/// We previously extended a `Message` type here, but that caused
/// ambiguity once multiple `Message` models existed in the project.
///
/// Keeping the file (empty) avoids project reference errors,
/// and you can re-introduce helpers here later if needed.
